A program to scrape the popular TV torrents on the
the pirate bay and group them by show. Maybe we'll put
a CLI over it so that you can browse / download
from the command line.

1. Run the program, scrape.rb
2. open the pirate bay
3. scrape each torrent
4. create an instance of a tv show for each torrent
